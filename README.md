## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

Project Idea: ReFood
My project idea is a web application that has two main focuses- reduce food waste and eliminate 
hunger in communities. While interning at a non-profit serving people experiencing homelessness, 
I would visit Panera every Thursday evening to pick up unpurchased baked goods to give to those 
in need on Friday morning. The amount of food from one day at Panera served over 75 people, and I 
begun to think about how much food is thrown out the other six days of the week and how it could
help many organizations. Furthermore, I thought about the food waste at other restaurants and the 
need for food by a sizeable population in my community.
The web application would consist of two logins- one for a food supplier and one for a receiver.
The format is flexible and open-ended, but I envisioned a way for the food supplier to post 
availability days and a receiver to request days. Once the request is approved by the food supplier,
that day is no longer available for other receivers. A recurring option (weekly, monthly, etc) would
help with consistency between suppliers and receivers. Primary points of contact for each 
organization will be included to provide an ease of communication between the two parties. I am 
passionate about the idea but open to many different ideas and possible implementations.
