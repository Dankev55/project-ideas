## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Two-Factor Authentication Application

This project is focused on developing a basic authenticator application for use in a two-factor authentication system. The plan is to design and develop an application (mobile or otherwise) that uses a time-based one-time password system: after synchronizing the application with a website, both the site and the application will simultaneously but independently generate and refresh a single-use password. The user receives the password from the application, and enters it into the website or device, where it is validated allowing the user to log in.

In order to develop and test such an application, it would also be necessary to develop a basic website with a login system. This scope of this project therefore covers both mobile app development and basic web development, although the intent of the project is to focus on the application aspect. The application should ideally be a mobile application in order to reflect a practical two-factor authentication system, but because the focus is on understanding the underlying systems that allow for 2FA to work, the platform on which the authenticator application is made is flexible.
