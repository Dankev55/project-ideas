## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Cooking Guru

Cooking Guru is a mobile and web application that will include two main services. As a mobile application, it will be available on both Android and Apple devices. The need for this application comes from the poor distribution of food currently in America. The first service is a pantry service which will allow users to enter in items that they currently have within their pantry. With this list of items, the users will then be able to search for a list of recipes that they can make given the items that they have listed within their account’s pantry. The application will be able to search for both recipes for cooking and recipes for drinks.

The second service will be a social media platform that allows users to connect and share their personal recipes. Most importantly, users will be able to post personal recipes 
as well as images of the dishes they have created. Users will also be able to connect with each other and search for popular/trending dishes. In addition to this, they will be able to like and favorite posts from other users in order to save them for later. Finally, users will be able to leave ratings on recipes that they have seen or tried, altering a recipe’s visibility to other users.
