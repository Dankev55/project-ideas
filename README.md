## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Meal Recommender

Ever since COVID began, people have been cooking in far more than they used to. As a result, there is often a random assortment of groceries left over in peopleâ€™s fridges and pantries. My idea is to create a mobile app that would allow people to enter the ingredients they had, and the app would suggest recipes that use those ingredients. In addition, the app would allow users to select the types of recipes that they preferred, so that those would be suggested. 

My vision is that the app would tap into some larger database of recipes. Once results for a certain group of ingredients is entered, the user could sort through the recipes using different filtering functions such as cuisine type or calories or spice level. Since I have a little bit of experience with python and react native, I am planning on using react native as my framework to complete the app. However, this is a place where I may change my plans should I find a more suitable framework to use in order to complete the app.
